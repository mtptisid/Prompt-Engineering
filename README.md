## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to maximize the quality and relevance of AI-generated outputs. It requires understanding the AI model's capabilities and limitations to craft prompts that guide the model toward desired responses.

## Key Techniques

### 1. Clear and Specific Prompts
Write concise and unambiguous prompts to reduce misinterpretation. Specify the desired format, tone, or level of detail.
- **Example**: Instead of "Tell me about history," use "Provide a 200-word summary of the Industrial Revolution in a formal tone."

### 2. Contextual Prompts
Provide relevant background information or context to help the AI understand the task better.
- **Example**: "As a high school student studying biology, explain photosynthesis in simple terms with an example."

### 3. Role-Based Prompts
Assign a specific role to the AI (e.g., teacher, expert, or assistant) to tailor the response style.
- **Example**: "Act as a data scientist and explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning."

### 4. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Encourage the AI to break down complex problems step-by-step to improve reasoning and accuracy.
- **Example**: "Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15. Show each step of your reasoning."

### 5. Few-Shot Prompting
Provide a few examples of the desired input-output pairs to guide the AI's response.
- **Example**: 
  ```
  Classify the sentiment of the following sentences as positive, negative, or neutral:
  1. I love this movie! (Positive)
  2. The service was terrible. (Negative)
  3. The weather is okay today. (Neutral)
  Now classify: The food was amazing!
  ```

### 6. Zero-Shot Prompting
Ask the AI to perform a task without providing examples, relying on its pre-trained knowledge.
- **Example**: "Translate 'Hello, world!' into French."

### 7. Instructional Prompts
Use explicit instructions to define the task, format, or constraints.
- **Example**: "Write a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number. Include comments and handle edge cases."

### 8. Negative Prompting
Specify what to avoid in the response to improve focus and relevance.
- **Example**: "Explain quantum mechanics in simple terms without using mathematical equations."

## Best Practices
- **Iterate and Refine**: Test different prompt variations to optimize results.
- **Be Precise**: Avoid vague terms; specify the scope and intent clearly.
- **Use Constraints**: Define word limits, formats, or styles when necessary.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure prompts handle unexpected inputs or scenarios.
- **Leverage Feedback**: Use AI responses to refine prompts for better outcomes.

## Examples
1. **Clear and Specific**:
   - Prompt: "Write a 100-word blog post about the benefits of meditation in a casual tone."
   - Purpose: Ensures concise, targeted content with a specific style.

2. **Few-Shot Prompting**:
   - Prompt: 
     ```
     Summarize the following texts in one sentence:
     Text 1: The sun is a star... (Summary: The sun is a star that provides energy to Earth.)
     Text 2: Photosynthesis is a process... (Summary: Photosynthesis converts sunlight into energy for plants.)
     Now summarize: Machine learning is a field of AI...
     ```
   - Purpose: Guides the AI to follow a specific summary format.

3. **Chain-of-Thought**:
   - Prompt: "To plan a trip to Paris, list three steps and explain each one."
   - Purpose: Encourages structured, detailed reasoning.
